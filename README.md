## GameSimulator

# About
This folder is a self-directed project to assist with simulating different game and card probabilities for a tabletop game designer.

Note: This project will begin by attempting to solve for the following use cases, but will likely grow / expand for future iterations.

1. Set an X number of suits with defined probabilities from a deck
2. Players will select a subset of these cards at random
3. They will be combined, and then "raced" - cards will be shuffled and selected at random, without replacement
4. The "base" or first use case game, will be a "first past the post" style race, ie: when Y number of the same suit of cards are selected that is determined the winner
5. This project will consist of creating a bot that can simulate one, and then multiple scenarios to then generate output data for analysis
